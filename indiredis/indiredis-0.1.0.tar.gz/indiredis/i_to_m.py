# snooping
#
# Normally every indiserver/device publishes on the from_indi topic (from indi device to the client)
#
# If a device wants to snoop on all other devices it subscribes to the to_ind topic
#
# Every device subscribes to snoop_control/#
# and to snoop_data/client_id
#
# If an indiserver/device wants to publish, it sends a getproperties to snoop_control/client_id
#
# All devices receive it, but the sending device, recognising its own id, ignores it.
#
# Any device receiving the getproperties, checks if the getproperties is relevant to itself.
#
# If it is, then it publishes its data to snoop_data/client_id, where client_id is the client_id of the originating request
#
# where the device, which is interested in that data, will receive it
